# Working With Remotes

1. Create a new branch on your local repository.
2. Make a commit on that branch.
3. Push the new branch up to GitHub.
4. Make another commit on that branch.
5. Push the branch again.
6. Have someone push another commit to your branch or edit a file in GitHub to
add a commit to your branch.
7. Pull down the changes to your branch.
