## Making a commit

To make a commit, make any changes that you want to include in this commit, fill
in the commit title, then click the `Commit to <branch>` button.

## Commit Messages

You may have noticed in the [previous section](#making-a-commit) that there's a
section for a `Description`. This is the space to add your commit message to
help other developers understand what it is you've changed.
