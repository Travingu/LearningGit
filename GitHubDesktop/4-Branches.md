# Branches

## Creating a branch

To create a branch, use the following command:

```bash
git branch <branch name>
```

You can then switch over to, or checkout, that branch with the following:

```bash
git checkout <branch name>
```

As a quick shortcut, you can do both of these at once with

```bash
git checkout -b <branch name>
```
