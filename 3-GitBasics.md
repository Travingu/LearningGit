# Git Basics

## Making a commit

Creating a commit consists of a adding untracked or unstaged files to the staging
area, then committing those changes with a commit message describing what it is
that has changed.

Here's how to do this:

- [VSCode](VSCode/3-GitBasics.md#making-a-commit)
- [GitHub Desktop](GitHubDesktop/3-GitBasics.md#making-a-commit)

## Commit Messages

- [CommandLine](CommandLine/3-GitBasics.md#commit-messages)

## The Commit Graph

We've discussed what the commit graph is [previously](1-WhatIsGit.md), however,
it can be beneficial to have a visual idea of what is going on.
