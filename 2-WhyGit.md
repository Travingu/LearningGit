# Why Git

Using a `version control system` (VCS) provides a lot of fantastic benefits and
there are a wide array of them out there. A small subset is listed below:

- Git
- Subversion
- Mercurial

Git happens to be the most widely used and taught VCS. Regardless of the VCS, the
following are reasons why using a VCS, such as Git, makes writing software easier.

## History

Version control allows us to review, and even modify, the history of changes
made to all of the files in the repository. This is important because if you ever
need to go back to an older version of the code you have written (due to no
longer wanting the changes you made, to see what it looked like for reference,
or one of many other reasons) without version control, you may end up with a file
tree like the one below:

```txt
my-cool-repository/
    version1/
    version2/
    version2.1/
    version2.1-final/
    version2.1-FINAL/
    version2.1-VeryFinal/
    version2.1Real/
    version2.1-REAL/
    backup/
    backup1/
```

Hopefully, from this example, you can see why tracking history without changing
the repository is important!

## Backing Up

Version control allows you to save and restore a previous version of your work
at any time.

## Sharing Code

## Separating Changes
