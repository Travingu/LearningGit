# Branches

## Creating a branch

To create a branch, open the `More Actions` menu:

![More Actions](../resources/VSCode/action_menu.png)

Then in the `Branch` submenu:

![Branch Menu](../resources/VSCode/branch_dropdown.png)

Select the `Create Branch...` option and provide a branch name:

![Create Branch](../resources/VSCode/create_branch.png)

You can then switch over to, or checkout, that branch using the `Checkout to...`
button in the `More Actions` menu:

![Checkout](../resources/VSCode/checkout.png)

Then select the branch that you want to check out.
