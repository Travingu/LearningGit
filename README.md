## Exercises

The below are all different exercises you can use to test your Git knowledge.

### Making your first commit

Let's start with the bread and butter of using Git, creating a commit.

- [Exercise 1](Exercises/E1-FirstCommit.md)

### Creating a working branch

Now that you've made commits to your repository, let's make a branch to keep our
next changes separate from others.

- [Exercise 2](Exercises/E2-CreatingABranch.md)

### Merging your WIP branch

Awesome! We've got a branch with our changes on it, but now we need to merge it
back to the main branch.

- [Exercise 3](Exercises/E3-Merging.md)

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

But, what happens when Git doesn't know what to do when you're merging? A merge
conflict that we'll have to resolve manually

- [Exercise 4](Exercises/E4-MergeConflicts.md)

### Working With a Remote

Let's share our work with the rest of the world by using a remote repository.

- [Exercise 5](Exercises/E5-WorkingWithRemotes.md)

### Creating a Pull Request

Sharing your changes is important. We'll use a Pull Request to let others know that
we have changes we'd like to merge into the main branch of the repository.

- [Exercise 6](Exercises/E6-PullRequests.md)

### Creating an Issue and solving it

Finally, let's put all of this together and go from creating an issue to having
the changes merged into the main branch.

- [Exercise 7](Exercises/E7-ResolvingAnIssue.md)
